      <h2>Camera Settings for Track Day Photography</h2>
      <p>Getting the right camera settings is crucial for capturing sharp, dynamic images at track days. Here are the essential settings you need to master:</p>
      
      <h3>Shutter Speed</h3>
      <p>For frozen action shots, use a shutter speed of at least 1/1000s or faster. For panning shots with motion blur, try 1/125s to 1/250s depending on the speed of the vehicles.</p>
      
      <h3>Aperture</h3>
      <p>Use f/2.8 to f/5.6 for individual cars to create a shallow depth of field. For group shots or wider scenes, use f/8 to f/11 to keep more of the scene in focus.</p>
      
      <h3>ISO</h3>
      <p>Keep ISO as low as possible (100-400) in good lighting conditions. In overcast conditions or late afternoon, you may need to increase to 800-1600.</p>
      
      <h2>Positioning and Composition</h2>
      <p>Where you position yourself at the track makes a huge difference to your photos. Look for corners where cars are turning, braking zones, or elevation changes that add drama to your shots.</p>
      
      <h3>Lens Choices</h3>
      <p>A 70-200mm f/2.8 lens is the workhorse for motorsport photography. For wider environmental shots, a 24-70mm is perfect. If you want to capture distant action, consider a 100-400mm or 150-600mm telephoto.</p>
      
      <h2>Panning Technique</h2>
      <p>Panning is essential for creating dynamic motion blur effects. Follow the car smoothly with your camera, keeping it in the same position in your frame. Press the shutter while continuing the pan, and follow through after the shot.</p>
      
      <h2>Post-Processing Tips</h2>
      <p>In post-processing, focus on enhancing colors, increasing contrast, and sharpening details. Be careful not to over-process – motorsport photography should look natural and dynamic.</p>

      <h2>What is Panning?</h2>
      <p>Panning is a photography technique where you follow a moving subject with your camera, creating a sharp subject against a motion-blurred background.</p>
      
      <h2>Camera Settings for Panning</h2>
      <p>Start with a shutter speed between 1/60s and 1/250s. Use continuous autofocus mode and set your camera to burst mode to increase your chances of getting the perfect shot.</p>
      
      <h2>Technique Steps</h2>
      <p>1. Position yourself perpendicular to the subject's path<br>
         2. Pre-focus on where the car will pass<br>
         3. Start tracking the car before it reaches you<br>
         4. Press the shutter while continuing to pan<br>
         5. Follow through after the shot</p>
      
      <h2>Practice Tips</h2>
      <p>Start with slower vehicles and gradually work up to faster ones. Practice your body movement - smooth rotation from the hips is key to successful panning.</p>

      <h2>RAW Processing</h2>
      <p>Always shoot in RAW format to preserve maximum image data. Start with basic adjustments to exposure, contrast, and white balance.</p>
      
      <h2>Color Correction</h2>
      <p>Adjust colors to make them pop while maintaining natural tones. Enhance the colors of the cars and environment without making them look artificial.</p>
      
      <h3>Selective Color Adjustments</h3>
      <p>Use HSL sliders to enhance specific colors. Make red cars more vibrant or adjust the green of grass and trees to create a more pleasing background.</p>
      
      <h2>Sharpening and Noise Reduction</h2>
      <p>Apply careful sharpening to bring out details in the cars. Use noise reduction to clean up high-ISO shots while preserving important details.</p>
      
      <h2>Cropping and Composition</h2>
      <p>Use the rule of thirds to create dynamic compositions. Leave space in front of moving cars to show where they're going.</p>
      
      <h2>Final Touches</h2>
      <p>Add subtle vignetting to draw attention to the subject. Use local adjustments to dodge and burn specific areas for added depth.</p>
